# Parth Ganeriwala Comprehensive Breadth Examination

In this exam, you will prepare a tutorial that explains the following method:

Point Set Registration: The Coherence Point-Drift Algorihtm (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.2635.pdf)

You may use any resource you find online (e.g., code, tutorials). But, I expect you to add background material, examples, experiments to your tutorial. Also, add a comparison and description of the standard ICP algorithm. Here, is a tutorial that can be your starting point:

Here is the authors project website:

Whenever possible, add example code to make the concepts and algorithm steps concrete (e.g., add
graphics, plots, examples). The code can be written as a Jupyter notebook and text material (including
equations) should be added to the notebook in LaTeX.
